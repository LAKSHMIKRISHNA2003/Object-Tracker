Real-Time Object Tracking with OpenCV and Mean Shift

Real-Time Object Tracking with OpenCV and Mean Shift is a Python-based computer vision project that tracks moving objects in real-time video using the Mean Shift algorithm. By selecting an initial region of interest (ROI) and analyzing its color distribution in the HSV color space, the system continuously updates the object's position across frames through histogram backprojection. Built with OpenCV, this project demonstrates a classical and efficient approach to object tracking, ideal for learning motion analysis and visual tracking fundamentals.

#How to Run Step-by-Step

Install Requirements (You need Python and OpenCV installed) : pip install opencv-python

Prepare the Video: Make sure sample.mp4 is placed in the same folder as your Python script.

Run the Code : Save the script as meanshift_tracker.py and run

>> python meanshift_tracker.py
